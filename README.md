## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

- I learned the masonry layout. I wanted to load the data dynamically, which made it implementing the layout tricky. I had to first load all the thumbnail images so that I could calculate the proper grid spans for each figure. I wonder if there is a better way to do it, but this was what I could come up with.

- I had a bit of difficulty implementing the lightbox layer so that the view can be scrolled. 

- Coming up with a working layout for the slide page was tricky for me. Each screen size has different arrangement and accommodating them was hard.

### Continued development

- I continue on the advanced CSS learning path.
